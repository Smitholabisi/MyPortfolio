                                 1. The company sales revenue were performing better in catergory like urban and in state like ontario and Alberta.
								  However, more sales strategies should be implemented in the regions, sectors and states not performing very well.  <br> 2. This Sales strategies should be considered, 
								 the company can target the low revenue states as well as sectors(Rural, mix and youth) in their Advertisment promotions go forward and also add new products or services that targets their audience. <br> 3. Create awareness of those products and give more discount on the products or services.
								 The Company can create a survey form for their customers to fill online or in-store, sometimes that won't take more than 5mins of their customers time.
								 <br> 4. Introduce a promotion sales where you buy one and get other one at half price. 
								 <br> 5. Monitor and study the areas and category doing well by checking the monthly performance of those products in term of weather, seasons and location of stores.

							<br> The top 10 products are Road bike, Mountain bikes, Helmets, Tires and Tubes, Touring bikes. </p>
							 Recommedation: 
							 <br> From the analysis done on this dataset, <br> 1. I will recommend that the organisation look into the year 2015 strategies that made the yearly profit increase more than the others. <br> 2. The weekday that has the highest profit was saturday while thursday has the least profit. So i will suggest the business put more products out on that saturday to increase their profit and give more sales offer for days that are not doing well.
